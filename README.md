# MS-Basic
GW-BASIC Interpreter for barebone computer like ESP32...

## Work in progress

This is a early work in progress.

## How is it done

Until now the first components are a command line (simple) and an Tokenizer.
That's all for now.

All things to be done are:

- An AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) analyser / builder;
- The command interpreter (for real);
- The functions tokenizer (until now only an instructions tokenizer exists).
